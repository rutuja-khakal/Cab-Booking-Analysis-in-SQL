# Cab-Booking-Analysis-in-SQL
The Cab Booking Management System is a SQL-based project designed to efficiently manage and analyze the operations of a cab service. This system helps in organizing customer and driver details, managing cab bookings, processing payments, and generating business insights.
Database Used: MySQL
Tools Used: MySQL Workbench
The system contains six tables with sample records:
Customers – Stores customer information.
Drivers – Contains driver details along with their ratings.
Cabs – Information about vehicles and their assigned drivers.
Bookings – Records of all cab bookings made by customers.
TripDetails – Stores trip-related data like distance, duration, and fare.
Payments – Details of payment transactions for completed trips.

Conclusion : The Cab Booking Management System project successfully demonstrates how SQL can be applied to manage and analyze real-world transportation business data. It provides valuable insights into driver performance, customer activity, revenue trends, and operational efficiency. Through structured data storage and meaningful queries, the system helps optimize cab services and improve decision-making.

Summary : In this project, I developed a Cab Booking Management System using SQL to help manage and analyze cab operations. The system organizes customer and driver data, tracks bookings, manages payments, and generates useful insights for business growth.
